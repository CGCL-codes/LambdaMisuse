Since the project is an open source project, I would prefer to respond
in the public community, for the benefit of all community members who
may have similar questions. So, if you wish me to respond, feel free
to ask on the pull request itself
(https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/892) or on our developer
mailing list (found at the project's website,
https://accumulo.apache.org).
