The expression was part of a stream processing expression. Streams do not provide a convenient mechanism for logic branch processing which was needed in this case. I could have found a stream/lambda based solution but it would have been more awkward.

Experience and testing proved that some branch logic was required to handle certain cases.

As stated, branch logic processing is hard to accomplish with existing stream processing mechanisms in Java. The degree of awkwardness to implement certain logic for me is a criteria for using lambda expressions. If the ROI of using the expression is too low then best to avoid it.
